# Meaningful Chance 

This is a simple site to turn a chance in to something more intuitive to understand.

[Live Demo](http://scommab.github.com/meaningful-chance/ "Live Demo")

# Nitty Gritty 

This basically works off of a set of "intuitive changes", and a javascript packing problem solver 

## Packing Problem Solvers

### Simple Solver
The simple solver just divides (and rounds down the result) by the largest value that will fit, until the result is 1.

### Smarter Solver
The smarter solver goes through all possible solutions until it finds something with in 10% of the entered number.
(The simple solver is needed because it's possibe this will fail)

## Intuitive Chances
* ![Coin Flip](http://scommab.github.com/meaningful-chance/img/things/coin_flip_small.png) Win a coin flip (1 in 2)
* ![Roll of Dice](http://scommab.github.com/meaningful-chance/img/things/roll_dice_small.png) Roll the same number on 2 dice (1 in 6)
* ![Roulette Wheel](http://scommab.github.com/meaningful-chance/img/things/roulette_wheel_small.png) Spinning double zero on a Roulette Wheel (1 in 38)
* ![Draw Card](http://scommab.github.com/meaningful-chance/img/things/pick_card_small.png) Pick the ace of spades from a deck of cards (1 in 52)
* ![Royal Flush](http://scommab.github.com/meaningful-chance/img/things/royal_flush_small.png) Being dealt a royal flush (1 in 649740) 

_TODO_: Think of more chances (it would be nice to have one for 1 in 5)
